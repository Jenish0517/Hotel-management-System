# HotelManagementSystem
Developed a console based Hotel Management System using Java and MySQL to manage guest bookings efficiently. The system supports full CRUD operations Add, Update, Delete, Search, and List bookings with automated bill calculations based on room type and stay duration. Implemented a DAO (Data Access Object) layer to separate business logic from database interactions, ensuring clean architecture and enhanced maintainability. The application dynamically creates and manages the database tables, performs secure database operations using prepared statements, and provides a user-friendly menu driven interface. This project demonstrates practical skills in JDBC connectivity, exception handling, SQL operations, and modular application design.
